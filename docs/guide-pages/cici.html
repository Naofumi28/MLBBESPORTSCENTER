        </div>
        <p>As the EXP laner of the team, Vengeance is a great choice because it helps you survive longer in fights by
            reflecting some of the damage you take back to your attackers.</p>
        <p>This fits well with the heroâ€™s ability to handle a lot of damage, making her hard to take down.</p>

        <h6>Recommended emblems and talents</h6>

        <div class="heroes-article-image">
            <img src="../assets/guides-image/g25.jpg" alt="Joy Guide Image 1">
            <small>Credit: ONE Esports</small>
            <p>As both the teamâ€™s frontliner and damage dealer, opting for the Fighter Emblem is ideal for Cici. This
                emblem offers essential stats to enhance her survivability in team fights, including Spell Vamp and
                Hybrid Defense.</p>
            <p>Regarding talents, prioritize Inspire for the extra Cooldown Reduction and Festival of Blood for Spell
                Vamp.</p>
            <p>The core talent for Cici should be Brave Smite, as it significantly contributes to her durability during
                the laning phase.</p>
            <p>Itâ€™s easier to trigger since Ciciâ€™s skills have low cooldowns and donâ€™t rely on mana, ensuring effective
                sustain in battles.</p>

            <h6>Cici best build</h6>

            <div class="heroes-article-image">
                <img src="../assets/guides-image/g26.jpg" alt="Joy Guide Image 2">
                <small>Credit: One Esports</small>
            </div>

            <p>The primary focus when building Cici should be on cooldown reduction and a balance between damage and
                durability.</p>
            <p>Start by prioritizing War Axe for its cooldown reduction and the added damage synergy with her offensive
                skills. Pair this with the Brute Force Breastplate which gives you a solid combination of offense,
                defense, and mobility, enhancing your ability to zone enemies out.</p>
            <p>As the game progresses into the mid-game, Oracle becomes essential for amplifying the heroâ€™s shield
                effects and providing substantial health regeneration. This makes you harder to kill and allows you to
                sustain longer in team fights.</p>
            <p>Increase your kill potential by purchasing Hunter Strike next. The item offers an extra burst of damage
                and mobility, giving her the edge in both chasing down opponents and repositioning during engagements.
            </p>
            <p>Round out your build by getting Blade Armor or Antique Cuirass depending on the enemy composition. Both
                items boost your Physical Defense and provide unique effects.</p>
            <p>If you want to play more defensively, you can swap the item for Immortality so you can resurrect when
                taken down.</p>

            <div class="ul-container">
                <ul>
                    <li>Tough Boots</li>
                    <li>War Axe</li>
                    <li>Bruteforce Breastplate</li>
                    <li>Oracle</li>
                    <li>Hunter Strike</li>
                    <li>Blade Armor or Antique Cuirass</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h6>Tips and easy combos to learn</h6>
            <p>In the laning phase, freeze the lane by positioning yourself at the back of the enemy minion wave,
                forcing the opposing EXP laner to get an advantage in positioning.</p>
            <p>Utilize Yo-Yo Blitz whenever the enemy hero approaches. If the enemy also has a strong early game, focus
                on last-hitting minions without pushing too far to avoid exposing yourself to potential ganks.</p>
            <p>Upon reaching level four, prioritize maxing Performerâ€™s Delight and keep an eye on the Turtle spawn on
                your side. Contest the Lord and assist the ally jungler in securing it.</p>

                <small>Credit: One Esports</small>
            </div>

            <p>Optimize your combo by initially maxing your passive ability, then engaging with Buoyant Bounce and Yo-Yo
                Blitz in team fights.</p>
            <p>If there are two or more enemies, manually direct the ultimate, Curtain Call, toward the enemy carry
                while dealing damage with Yo-Yo Blitz.</p>
            <p>Always ensure you have full stacks of Performerâ€™s Delight before entering fights for maximum
                effectiveness.</p>
