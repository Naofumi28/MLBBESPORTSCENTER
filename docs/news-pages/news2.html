        His Baxia Mark passive reduces enemy damage dramatically, while his
        Baxia-Shield Unity ability allows him to retract to a wheel and rotate
        quickly around the map. This makes him a constant threat in the lanes
        and a formidable presence during team fights, capable of soaking up
        damage while his teammates focus on dealing it.
      </div>

      <div class="article-text">
        But to fully leverage the power of jungle Baxia's abilities, it's
        crucial to understand the best items to equip him in the game.

      <h3 class="section-title">The 3 best items to buy for jungle Baxia</h3>

        <h4>Cursed Helmet</h4>

        </div>
        <p class="article-text">
          Like most tank junglers in the game, jungle Baxia benefits greatly
          from having Cursed Helmet. This item offers additional HP and Magic
          Resistance, boosting your survivability against magic damage
          dealers.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          But what sets the Cursed Helmet apart is its unique passive ability,
          Burning Soul. This powerful ability inflicts a percentage of your
          max HP as magic damage per second to enemies nearby.

        <h4>Guardian's Helmet</h4>

          <p class="image-caption">Credit: ONE Esports</p>
        </div>
        <p class="article-text">
          While extremely durable, jungle Baxia can be taken down by heroes
          who can deal True Damage like Karrie or Alpha. As such, boosting
          your HP as much as you can will let you survive for longer against
          these heroes.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          When it comes to health boosts and defensive stats, few items can
          compare to what Guardian's Helmet can provide. Not only does it give
          your jungle Baxia a major HP boost, but it also offers consistent
          health regeneration.
