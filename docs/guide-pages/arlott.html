                    <h4>Ability 1: Lancer's Charge</h4>
                    <p>Arlott charges forward, dealing physical damage to all enemies in his path and knocking them
                        back. This ability is ideal for closing gaps and dealing initial damage to enemies, making it a
                        powerful tool for initiating fights.</p>

                        enemies or escape dangerous situations.</p>

                        area and stunning them for a short duration. This ability is ideal for dealing a decisive blow

        <h6>A comprehensive guide on how to play Arlott in Mobile Legends</h6>

        <p class="section-title">Recommended battle spell</p>

        </div>
        <p>To make the most of his abilities, itâ€™s recommended to use Petrify as a Battle Spell since its stun effect
            activates his Demon Gaze passive.</p>
        <p>This allows him to extend his combo with the extra stun and deal more damage to his enemies.</p>
        <p>However, if you plan to play him as a roamer, it might be a good idea to go for Vengeance instead. This
            Battle Spell enhances his survivability, ensuring that he lasts long in team fights after using Final Slash
            to start a team fight.</p>

        <h6>Recommended emblem</h6>

        <div class="heroes-article-image">

            <small>Credit: ONE Esports</small>

            <p>For his emblem, you can choose the Tank emblem if you are playing as a roamer or the Fighter emblem if
                you are in the EXP lane.</p>

            <p>This allows Novaria to swiftly reposition herself in sticky situations.</p>
            <p>When playing Arlott in the side lanes, get Thrill for early game damage, and Wilderness Blessing for
                increased Movement Speed in the river and jungle areas. This combination of talents allows you to clear
                lanes fast and rotate quickly to other lanes to help out.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="highlight">Mobile Legends Emblem system guide: All talents and best emblem setup</p>
            <p>When playing as a roamer, customize the Tank emblem to get Rupture for early game kiting, and Tenacity
                for better survivability on low health.</p>
            <p>The best core talent for him regardless of role is Brave Smite since it helps him survive in team fights
                with its HP restoration effect. Arlott has low cooldowns on his skills, so itâ€™s ideal to go for spell
                vamp emblems.</p>
            <h6>Arlott best build</h6>

            </div>

            <p>When playing as an EXP laner, itâ€™s essential to prioritize survivability. Get Thunder Belt early on. It
                offers great synergy with Arlottâ€™s skills by providing a mix of tankiness, cooldown reduction, and
                additional True Damage with its passive, enhancing your burst potential.</p>

            </p>

            <p>Follow this up with Hunter Strike to boost your Physical Damage and mobility through its passive. This
                passive triggers a Movement Speed boost after hitting enemies, allowing you to be more aggressive in
                chasing or escaping.</p>
            <p>As you progress to the mid-game, purchase Dominance Ice. This item is vital for controlling enemies by
                reducing their healing effects and Attack Speed while giving a decent amount of armor and cooldown
                reduction.</p>

            <p>Take Oracle to enhance your sustainability. This magic defense item amplifies your shield and
                regeneration effects, making you tougher in extended fights.</p>
            <p>Finally, Queenâ€™s Wings provides both damage reduction and lifesteal when your health gets low, allowing
                you to survive crucial moments and turn fights around.</p>
            <p>When playing Arlott as a roamer, get Dominance Ice right after Thunder Belt, then boost your Magic
                Defense by getting Athenaâ€™s Shield or Radiant Armor.</p>

            <h6>Tips and easy combos to learn</h6>

            <p>During the laning phase, you can start off by using Dauntless Strike to mark minion waves and secure last
                hits with Vengeance as you stay ahead of your opponent.</p>
            <p>If youâ€™re feeling more aggressive in the laning phase, wait for Demon Gaze to affect the enemy hero
                youâ€™re matched against and pounce with Vengeance to get closer. Once you exhaust the mark, use the
                Dauntless Strike-Vengeance-Final Slash-Vengeance combo for an easy kill.</p>

            <p class="highlight">5 most explosive Flicker ultimate combos to pull off in Mobile Legends</p>

            <p>During team fights, wait for the enemy to gather together and use Final Slash to line them up in single
                file. Then, use Vengeance to deal damage and stun them once again with Dauntless Strike. If you happen
                to miss a target, fall back since Arlott is easy to kill once his only mobility skill is on cooldown.
