                    <p>Novaria summons a burst of energy from the stars, dealing magic damage to all enemies in the area
                        of effect. This ability can be used to clear waves and poke enemies from a distance, making her
                        an excellent mid-lane mage.</p>

                    <h4>Ability 2: Cosmic Shield</h4>
                    <p>Novaria creates a cosmic barrier around herself or an ally, reducing incoming damage for a few
                        seconds. This ability can be used strategically to protect allies or herself during critical
                        moments of a fight.</p>

                        huge amounts of magic damage to all enemies in the area. It also stuns them for a short
                        duration, making it perfect for initiating team fights or securing kills in the late game.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Flameshot proves to be the optimal choice for Novaria as it complements her long-range abilities seamlessly.
            By combining Flame Shot with Astral Recall, she can unleash even greater damage onto her targets.</p>
        <p>However, in scenarios where the enemy team consists of multiple assassin heroes or possesses high burst
            damage, opting for a safer approach with the battle spell Flicker is advisable.</p>

            <p>This allows Novaria to swiftly reposition herself in sticky situations.</p>
            <h6>Recommended emblem and talent set</h6>
            <p>Opting for the mage emblem is ideal for maximizing Novariaâ€™s damage output, as it bolsters her magic
                power, reduces cooldowns, and enhances magic penetration.</p>
            <p>In terms of sub-talents, selecting Rupture grants a flat adaptive penetration boost, while Bargain Hunter
                helps you complete your core items much faster with the 5% discount on equipment purchases.</p>

            <p class="highlight">Mobile Legends Emblem system guide: All talents and best emblem setup</p>
            <p>For her core talent, Impure Rage is the most suitable option. This talent not only provides adaptive
                damage but also increases mana regeneration.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Since youâ€™ll be using your skill often, going for Enchanted Talisman for the mana regeneration or Clock
                of Destiny for the mana boost is the way to go.</p>
            <p>After that, youâ€™ll want to focus on increasing your magic power and penetration. Holy Crystal, Glowing
                Wand, Lightning Truncheon, and Divine Glaive are safe options.</p>

            <h6>Easy combos to learn for Novaria</h6>

            <p>During the laning phase, prioritize clearing minion waves using Astral Meteor and harass enemies with
                Astral Recall. To sustain your mana without needing frequent recalls, consider building Elegant Gem as
                your first item.</p>
            <p>In team fights, start by using Astral Echo to see where the enemies are hiding. Once the situation is
                favorable, unleash Astral Recall, targeting the enemyâ€™s backline heroes. Alternatively, initiate with
                Astral Meteor to slow them down before swiftly finishing them off with Astral Recall.</p>
            <p>Due to Novariaâ€™s squishiness, focus on positioning yourself well, away from enemy assassins. If you find
                yourself caught in a dangerous situation, use Astral Recall to escape and maneuver through walls, making
                it more challenging for pursuers to catch up.</p>
