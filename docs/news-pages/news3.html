          With this win, Selangor Red Giants secure the lion's share of the
          US$100,000 prize pool and will represent Malaysia, alongside Team
          Vamos, at the M6 World Championship, which will be held on their
          home turf. The team was a force to reckon with in the regular
          season, dropping only a single series. They then stumbled against
          Todak in the playoffs and were sent to the lower bracket.

          They recovered, defeating Todak in a rematch during the lower
          bracket final to earn their place in the grand final and ultimately
          seize the championship.

          Selangor Red Giants wins MPL MY Season 14 title in intense grand
          final showdown against Team Vamos
        </h3>
        <p class="article-text">
          Selangor Red Giants started the series with a statement, securing a
          dominating victory in the opening game. Team Vamos, however, showed
          resilience, bouncing back to even the series at 1-1.

          Despite the early setback, the defending champions proved their
          mettle. They powered through games three and four, with standout
          performances from jungler Muhammad Haqqullah "Sekys" Ahmad Shahrul
          Zaman and roamer Muhammad "Yums" Suhairi, whose MVP-worthy plays
          shifted the momentum in Selangor Red Giants' favor.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          Game five saw Team Vamos implement a team-fight-heavy composition,
          featuring Hylos, Cecilion, and Suyou, aimed at countering Sekys'
          signature Alpha pick alongside their formidable Mathilda–Ixia combo.
